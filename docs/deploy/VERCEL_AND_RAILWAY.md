# Vercel + Railway (monorepo) — step by step

This repo is a **pnpm workspace**. Vercel must install from the **repository root** so `workspace:*` packages resolve. Each app’s [`vercel.json`](../../apps/pk-store/vercel.json) (see also [`apps/admin`](../../apps/admin/vercel.json) / [`apps/dashboard`](../../apps/dashboard/vercel.json)) sets `installCommand` and `buildCommand` — in the Vercel UI, **clear any manual overrides** for Install / Build so the project uses these files (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](../../DEPLOYMENT.md) §3–§5).

## One repository — three Vercel projects (not one)

<a id="vercel-one-repo-three-projects"></a>

Vercel treats **one project = one app = one main production URL**. A single Vercel project **cannot** deploy the storefront, dashboard, and admin as three separate sites. That is why importing with **Root directory `apps/admin`** only deploys **admin**.

To have **all three** frontends on Vercel:

1. **Add three Vercel projects** that all use the **same GitHub repository**, each with a different **Root directory**:
   - `apps/pk-store`
   - `apps/dashboard`
   - `apps/admin`
2. In each project: **Add New** → **Project** → import the **same** repo, then set the root folder as above. You are not forking the repo; you are linking one repo to three projects.
3. On every **git push** to the connected branch, **each** of the three projects can run a build (unless you add an **Ignored Build Step** to skip). So all three can deploy from “one” workflow without merging them into a single Vercel project.
4. **Do not** create a Vercel project for `apps/api` — the API stays on **Railway** (see below).

## What you will create

| Platform | Projects | Root Directory in UI | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vercel | Storefront | `apps/pk-store` | Public shop (Vite) |
| Vercel | Dashboard | `apps/dashboard` | Store owner dashboard (Next.js) |
| Vercel | Admin | `apps/admin` | Platform admin (Next.js) |
| Railway | API (one service) | **`.` (repo root)** | Backend (`apps/api`) via `Dockerfile.api` |

## 1) Database (Neon or any Postgres)

1. Create a database and copy `DATABASE_URL` (SSL on).
2. You will paste it into **Railway** (API) and use it locally for migrations.

## 2) Railway — API (recommended: Docker from repo root)

1. New project → **Deploy from GitHub** → select this repo.
2. **Service → Settings → Root Directory**: leave **empty** or `.` (repository root).  
   Do **not** set Root Directory to `apps/api` unless you switch to the alternate build in `apps/api/railway.toml`.
3. **Build**: Railway should pick up root [`railway.toml`](../../railway.toml) and [`Dockerfile.api`](../../Dockerfile.api).
4. **Variables** (minimum — add the rest from [DEPLOYMENT.md](../../DEPLOYMENT.md)):

| Variable | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://…` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | long random string |
| `PORT` | `3000` |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |

5. Deploy, then open the **public URL** Railway gives you (e.g. `https://xxx.up.railway.app`). Frontends need the **API base URL including `/api`**, e.g. `https://xxx.up.railway.app/api`, for `VITE_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

### Migrations (from your laptop)

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://…"
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

## 3) Vercel — Web (`apps/pk-store`)

1. New project → same GitHub repo.
2. **Root Directory**: `apps/pk-store`.
3. Framework: Vite (from `vercel.json`).
4. **Environment variables**:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_URL` | `https://<your-railway-api-host>/api` |
| `VITE_DEFAULT_STORE` | tenant slug, e.g. `zorvik` |

5. Deploy.

## 4) Vercel — Dashboard (`apps/dashboard`)

1. New project → same repo.
2. **Root Directory**: `apps/dashboard`.
3. **Environment variables**:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `https://<your-railway-api-host>/api` |

4. Deploy.

## 5) Vercel — Admin (`apps/admin`)

1. New project → same repo.
2. **Root Directory**: `apps/admin`.
3. **Environment variables**:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `https://<your-railway-api-host>/api` |

4. Deploy.

## 6) Custom domains + CORS

1. Attach domains in Vercel (web / dashboard / admin) and in Railway (API) if you use a custom hostname.
2. Point DNS (CNAME / ALIAS) as each provider instructs.
3. After URLs are final, **update** `VITE_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the production API base (must include `/api`) and redeploy all Vercel projects.
4. If the API blocks unknown origins, add your Vercel domains to the API CORS allowlist in code or env (whatever this project uses).

## 7) Quick verification

- API: `GET …/api/healthz` (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](../../DEPLOYMENT.md)).
- Web: homepage loads and product/API calls hit the Railway URL (browser Network tab).
- Dashboard / Admin: login page loads; API calls use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

## Repo layout (for deploy)

```text
zorvik/
  apps/
    pk-store/      ← Vercel project 1 (Root: apps/pk-store)
    dashboard/     ← Vercel project 2 (Root: apps/dashboard)
    admin/           ← Vercel project 3 (Root: apps/admin)
    api/             ← Built inside Docker (Railway root: .)
  packages/        ← shared workspace packages (installed from root)
  Dockerfile.api   ← API production image (build context = repo root)
  railway.toml     ← Railway build = Dockerfile.api (repo root)
```

## Alternate: Railway Root Directory = `apps/api`

Only if you prefer a smaller service scope: set Root Directory to `apps/api` and rely on [`apps/api/railway.toml`](../../apps/api/railway.toml) (Nixpacks + `buildCommand` that runs `pnpm` from the monorepo root). The Docker path above is usually easier to reason about.
